Teff_rad_mass_lum
=================

Programs for calculating effective temperature, radius, mass and luminosity of K and M dwarfs.

Rad/Mass/Lum calculations are done based on empirical relations from Mann et al. (2013c).

Effective temperature code from Mann et al. (2013c) is undergoing significant changes for a larger paper on the LG11 sample (Gaidos et al. in prep). I will upload the revised code when the paper is submitted.
